`Here we need to repeat string n times from given string and calculate number of a is present there`

## Algorithms

1. calculate the length of string 
2. then calculate the divisible value (n/size) for count how many a have in repeating chareaters
3. then calculate the mod value of for extra calculations
4. result = (divisible * count) + extra;
