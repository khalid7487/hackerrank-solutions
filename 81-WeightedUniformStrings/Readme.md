## Time complexity: O(n)

## Algorthms
1. make a object with all alphabet
2. make another object where we need to store current sum wise true value
3. if word is not same with net word then make sure change 1st word
4. then loop throgh the quries and  check it is equal to the index or not
5. if index == breakword[weight] then true  and push into an array
6. else false and push into an array
7. return array
