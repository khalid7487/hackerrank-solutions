## Viral advertising is problem where we basically need to calculate cumulative numbers

`` When they launched new product they have exactly 5 people on social media. ``

`` On first day half of those 5 people (floor(5/2) =2) and each day floor(recipients/2)``

**sudo code of this problem**
  `` 1. Loop through i=0 to n  ``
  `` 2. define sharedAds=5``
  `` 3. likeAds from floor(sharedAds/2) `` 
  `` 4. count cumulativeAds `` 
  `` 5. updateSharedAds with multiple by 3  ``
  `` 6. return cumulative Ads. ``
