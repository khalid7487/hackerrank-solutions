`Here we need to rotated array with a condition (i + k) % len `

## Algorithms 
1. calculate the length and make a length wise a array
2. loop through and rotated the array with rotated[(i + k) % len] = a[i] this conditions.
3. the loop through the queries array and get the item and push into another array 
4. return the array
