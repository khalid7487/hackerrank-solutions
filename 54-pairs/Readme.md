`Here we need to make a pair using key value and calculate how many pair are match with the key value. `

**My complexity is o(n)**

## Algorithms
1. Make a object from that array.
2. then loop through the array 
3. val = item - key
4. check the is available in object or not 
5. if available in object count pair.
6. return count
